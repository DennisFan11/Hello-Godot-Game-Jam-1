start_1,"We felt the other presence that day
Disturbed our peaceful life
Took our friends and families
Destroyed our home

We thought of the words passed down by the older generation.
When danger comes, go to the Holy Place and seek the Eyes of Dragon""

We don't know what the Eyes of Dragon are
But that is our only way","那天，我們感受到有其他生物
闖進了我們原本平靜的生活
帶走了我們的同伴
奪走了我們的家園

我們想起了老一輩的人傳下來的話
“當危險來臨，就去尋找龍之眼”

我們不知道龍之眼到底是什麼
但這是我們唯一的辦法"
start_2,"After we entered the sanctuary
an earthquake hit

We got separated from each other
Now, in addition to finding the Eye of the Dragon

We must find each other...","我們進入聖地後
發生了地震

我們與彼此走散
現在除了找到龍之眼

我們必須找到彼此……"
end_1,"We feel our body changing
The warmth inside makes us open our eyes

The next moment, we are passing through tunnels
Emerging from the lake
Soaring into the sky","一瞬間，我們的身體起了變化
體內的溫熱讓我們睜開了眼睛

下一秒，我們穿過黑暗的隧道
衝出湖面
飛向天空"
end_2,"Those bipedal creatures look at us in fear
Holding our friends and families trapped in crystals","那些以雙腳行走的生物驚恐地看著我們
手裡抱著被水晶困住的同伴"
end_3,"Flames ignited, we roar",體內燃起的火焰使我們咆哮
end_4,"Perhaps we are no longer the way we once were
But what we want has never changed.","也許我們不再是當初的模樣
但我們想要的一直都沒變"
end_5,We just want to live in peace...,我們只想安靜地活著……
